# Java Random Number Sorting and Searching Project

## Overview

This project involves generating an array of 1000 random numbers, sorting them using different sorting algorithms, and searching for specific numbers in both unsorted and sorted arrays. The performance of the sorting and searching algorithms is measured in terms of time taken, and the results are recorded in tables. The project will also perform conversions of CPU cycles to seconds.

The project involves the following key components:
- Random number generation and saving them to a file
- Linear search on an unsorted file
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble sort, Merge sort, Quick sort)
- Binary search on sorted files
- Measuring and recording execution time for various algorithms

## Files

1. **RandNumb.txt**: Contains 1000 random numbers (0-999), generated and saved.
2. **Sorted Files**: Files generated by each sorting algorithm, including:
   - Bubble sort: `bubble_sorted.txt`
   - Merge sort: `merge_sorted.txt`
   - Quick sort: `quick_sorted.txt`
3. **Tables**: Contain recorded times for each algorithm's performance and search operations in tabular format.
   - **Table 1**: Linear search times for numbers 1, 500, and 900 in `RandNumb.txt`.
   - **Table 2**: Time taken for each sorting algorithm (Bubble sort, Merge sort, Quick sort) and the search operations.
   - **Table 3**: Time taken for Binary search on sorted files.
   - **Table 4**: Summary of all computed times (Linear search time + Binary search + Sorting time).

## Steps and Features

### 1. **Generate Random Numbers**

- The program generates an array of 1000 random numbers in the range of 0 to 999 using Java's built-in random number generation functions.
- These numbers are saved to a file called `RandNumb.txt`.

### 2. **Linear Search**

- Linear search is performed on `RandNumb.txt` to find the numbers 1, 500, and 900.
- The time taken for each search operation is recorded in **Table 1**.

### 3. **Sorting Algorithms**

Three sorting algorithms are implemented to sort the random numbers in `RandNumb.txt`:
- **Bubble Sort**: The `bubble_sorted.txt` file contains the numbers sorted using the bubble sort algorithm.
- **Merge Sort**: The `merge_sorted.txt` file contains the numbers sorted using the merge sort algorithm.
- **Quick Sort**: The `quick_sorted.txt` file contains the numbers sorted using the quick sort algorithm.

The execution time for each sorting algorithm is recorded in **Table 2**.

### 4. **Binary Search**

Binary search is performed on the sorted files (`bubble_sorted.txt`, `merge_sorted.txt`, `quick_sorted.txt`) to search for the numbers 1, 500, and 900.
- The time taken for each search operation is recorded in **Table 3**.

### 5. **Time Conversion**

- The CPU cycles are conv# Java Random Number Sorting and Searching Project
